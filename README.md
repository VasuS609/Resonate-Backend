# Resonate - An Open Source Social Voice Platform

### This project is divided into two repositories:

1. [Resonate Flutter App](https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Resonate)
2. Resonate Backend (You are here)

Go to [this repository](https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Resonate) to know more about the project.

## Environment Setup

1. Pre-requisites

    (a) Fork the Repo

    (b) Clone the Repo: `git clone https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Resonate-Backend`

2. Follow this guide to obtain your Livekit credentials

- Guide: https://docs.livekit.io/cloud/project-management/keys-and-tokens/
- You will need `LIVEKIT_HOST`, `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`, `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`.

3. Set up environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Windows:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

or (CMD):

```cmd
copy .env.example .env
```

Then fill in the values in `.env`:
- Leave the database/collection IDs as they are (they match the project structure)
- Add your Livekit credentials (see step 2)
- Add your email credentials (see step 5)

4. Set up Appwrite

- Create a new project on [Appwrite Cloud](https://appwrite.io/) or self host it locally by pulling their [docker image](https://appwrite.io/docs/self-hosting). Know more about Appwrite [here](https://appwrite.io/docs).
- Create an API key with necessary scopes.
- Import the database structure: `appwrite deploy collection`.
- Copy the generated database and collection IDs into your `.env` file.
- Important: Appwrite functions do not read from your local `.env`. You must set function variables in Appwrite:
  - Console: Go to Project → Functions → Select a function → Settings → Variables → add keys/values.
  - CLI example:
    - `appwrite client --endpoint https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1 --projectId <PROJECT_ID> --key <API_KEY>`
    - `appwrite functions update --functionId <FUNCTION_ID> --vars APPWRITE_API_KEY=<...>,VERIFICATION_DATABASE_ID=<...>,OTP_COLLECTION_ID=<...>,SENDER_MAIL=<...>,SENDER_PASSWORD=<...>`

5. Email configuration (for OTP functionality)

- Set `SENDER_MAIL` to your email address.
- Set `SENDER_PASSWORD` to your app password (Gmail guide: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en).

6. Security note

- Do not hardcode secrets in `appwrite.json`. Use environment variables. The template `.env.example` lists all variables required across functions.
- Note: `appwrite.json` does not read from `.env`. Set function variables in the Appwrite Console (or via Appwrite CLI) for cloud execution; `.env` is for local configuration/reference.
- Tip: Keep `.env` as a convenient record of values; replicate them into Appwrite Function Variables for actual use.
